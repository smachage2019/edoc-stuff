# # Analysis of harmonics
# 
# The idea behind this script is to explore the data series for seasonal trends, using a 
# fourier decomposition of the time series, aggregated by climatic seasons (resampled and sliced 
# every 3 months).
# 
# The analysis goes as follows:
# 
# - Loading the data
# - Filling the gaps
# - Resampling at different scales (3 months, 6 months, 1 and 4 years)
# - Slicing the data by seasons
# - Applying the Fourier transform over each of the seasonal data
# - Filtering out minor frequencies (below 500 in the power spectrum)
# - Recomposing the original series only with the major frequency

# # Results and conclusions
# 
# From the analysiis it can be seen that indeed there seems to be a trend  in the 
# last 150 years (from year 100 and forth) to increment the average temperature in 
# each season.
# 
# Seems that the average temperature in spring is more variable thatn the rest of the 
# seasons, however one of the main harmonics of the series seem to reveal that the 
# large temperature fluctations in the winter are consistent with the main variations
# of temperature in the winter. This appear to occur in a 25-30 years cycles at the 
# beggining of the series, and in 18-20 years cycles at the end of the series 
# (industrialisation perhaps?).
# 
# On the contrary, oscilations in the fall are far more stable, indicating more stable
# patterns. Therefore, we migh think on using average fall temperature as an indicator 
# of the Land Average Temperature (LAM), in the detection of long term variations of temperature.
# 
# Also is interesting to see how the trends between winter and summer have appear to change
# in the latter 150 years. In the first period, summer and winter appear to have similar
# trends, as cold winters lead to cold summers, however this trend seem to change in the 
# second period, especially towards the end, in which an inversion is found, for which cold winters 
# seem to be paired up with warm summers. Looks like the weather may be changing indeed.
